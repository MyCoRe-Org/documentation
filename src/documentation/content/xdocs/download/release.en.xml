  <p>
    MyCoRe 2.1.1 (or 2.1-fixes) is a release of the <em>new Version</em>. This new release 2.1.1 comes with a new
    version of the image viewer (IView2), with a new conception of the Internal File System (IFS2) and a
    new implementation of the OAI interface (OAI2). 
    Furthermore the module concept has been improved and now Maven is integrated.
    You can find an overview of all innovations on the documentation site
    <a href="site:whats_new_2_1">"Was ist neu?"</a>. A detailed list of changes
    is provided in the <a href="site:changelog">Changelog</a>.
  </p>
       
  <p>
    If you have your application already near version 2.1.1, you only have to update
    your pom.xml (docportal/config):
    
    <pre class="brush: xml;gutter: false;">
&lt;groupId>org.mycore&lt;/groupId>
&lt;artifactId>application-model&lt;/artifactId>
&lt;version>2.1.1-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version></pre>
  
    In the next step you have to build your application again (<code>ant resolve create.jar
    create.scripts create.webapp</code>).

    Furthermore there is a MyCoRe 
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mycore/files/mycore/2.1/">jar file</a>

    independent from DocPortal. MyCoRe can be integrated as well via Maven.
